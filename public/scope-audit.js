/* === CoreScope — scope-audit.js ===
   Network-wide scope audit (route #/scope-audit): the whole-network answer
   to "which repeaters declare a region they are not actually forwarding".
   Fetches GET /api/scope-audit once per window and renders one row per
   declared repeater, sorted server-side so the interesting rows (missing a
   declared region, or contradicting its own wildcard) sit at the top.
   Reuses node-scopes.js's vocabulary: scope names are shown without the
   leading '#' (the two backends spell them differently — see normScope
   there), and '*' is never listed as a scope. */
