//	  resolved_path = COALESCE(excluded.resolved_path, resolved_path)
//
// Two things follow, and collapseDuplicatesAndIndex has to honour both to be a
// faithful replay rather than an approximation of it.
//
// First, `excluded` is the incoming row, so a non-NULL later value REPLACES an
// earlier one. Applied down a group in insertion order the result is the LAST
// non-NULL value, not the first.
//
// Second, every other column is absent from the SET list, so the UPSERT never
// touches it: the surviving row keeps its own direction, timestamp, path_json
// and so on. Merging those too would invent history the ingestor would not have
// written.

// dupGroupsDDL materialises one row per duplicate group: the group key plus the
// earliest id, which is the row that is kept and merged into.
//
// Materialised rather than left as a repeated subquery on purpose. In the
// subquery form every merged column's UPDATE re-ran this GROUP BY over the whole
// observations table — measured at 9.7s on 2.4M rows holding only 5 duplicates,
// nearly all of it the same scan performed repeatedly. This runs inside a write
// transaction and holds the write lock for its duration, so the repetition is
// worth removing.
// The WHERE clause is the whole correctness of this query, and leaving it out
// destroys data.
//
// GROUP BY folds all NULLs into one group. A UNIQUE index does the opposite:
// SQLite treats NULLs as distinct, so a row with NULL in any indexed column can
// never violate it. Group without excluding them and the repair calls rows
// duplicates that the index would have accepted, then deletes them to build an
// index that did not need them gone.
//
// Not hypothetical: on an 11.2M-row instance, 198 of the 222 groups this
// reported had observer_idx IS NULL — 238 of the 262 rows it planned to delete.
// They were direction='tx' rows, and the index built without complaint once
// they were left alone.
//
// transmission_id is NOT NULL in the schema and COALESCE(path_json, ”) can
// never be NULL, so observer_idx is the only one that needs the guard; it is
// written out in full anyway, because the next person to add a column to this
// index should see the rule rather than infer it.
